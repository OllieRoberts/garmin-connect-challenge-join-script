# Garmin Connect Challenge Auto-Join Script

This repository contains a JavaScript snippet that automates joining all available challenges on the Garmin Connect Challenge page. The script identifies **Join** buttons and simulates user clicks to save time and effort.

## How It Works
1. Finds all **Join** buttons on the Garmin Connect Challenge page using the `aria-label="Join Challenge"` attribute.
2. Loops through each button and simulates a real mouse click using `MouseEvent`.
3. Adds a short delay (1.5 seconds) between clicks to ensure smooth interaction with the page.

## Usage
1. Open the [Garmin Connect Challenges](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/challenge) page in your browser.
2. Open the browser's developer console:
   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
   - Go to the **Console** tab.
3. Copy and paste the script below into the console and press **Enter**.

## Script
```javascript
(async () => {
    // Find all 'Join' buttons by matching the aria-label attribute
    const joinButtons = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label="Join Challenge"]'));

    console.log(`Found ${joinButtons.length} Join buttons to click`);

    // Loop through each button and simulate clicks
    for (let index = 0; index < joinButtons.length; index++) {
        console.log(`Clicking Join button ${index + 1} of ${joinButtons.length}`);
        
        // Dispatch a mouse click event for better interaction
        joinButtons[index].dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', {
            bubbles: true,
            cancelable: true,
            view: window
        }));

        // Wait 1.5 seconds between clicks to ensure smooth interaction
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1500));
    }

    console.log("All challenges should now be joined!");
})();
```

## The Ironic Note
Sure, itâ€™s quicker to click manually on a few challenges, but whereâ€™s the fun in that? ðŸ˜‰
